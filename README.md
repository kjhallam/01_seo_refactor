<h1>Horiseon</h1>
_______________________
<h2><i>Semantics</i> comes <b>ALIVE</b></h2>
________________

<i>Where non-semantic tags were transformed to semantic tags.</i>

    Horiseon (SEO)  is designed to inform individuals of what it means to research information right at your fingertips.

Through transforming the SEO website I created "alt" attributes for each image displayed on the website only to prepare a user friendly website for all clients and consumers who research the SEO brand.  

Just beyond the "Horiseon" I've displayed information about:
 - Brand Awareness

 - Cost Management

 - Digital Marketing

 - Lead Generation

 - Online Reputation

 - Social Media Marketing

 - SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
